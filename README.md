HANGMAN GAME in C++

This is a hangman game we made in dev c++ using simple functions. To make this game work , you will need to use the uploaded .cpp file on any compiler . A number of libraries like ctime and cstdlib are used for the computer to choose random Month name from the array of months provided by us .

INSTRUCTIONS
You'll be given 3 tries to guess the random month chosen by the computer that will be displayed in "XXXXX..." format . If your attempted 3 tries are incorrect , you'll be hanged by the hangman game .

HOPE YOU ENJOY THE GAME!!
